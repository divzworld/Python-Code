# Que.23 Filter words with vowels > 2 using lambda.
"""
ğŸ§  What the Question is Asking
"Filter words with vowels > 2 using lambda."
Step-by-step meaning:

You have a list of words, e.g.
["apple", "sky", "education", "python"]
For each word, count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) it has:
apple â†’ a,e â†’ 2 vowels
sky â†’ y (not counted normally) â†’ 0 vowels
education â†’ e,u,a,i,o â†’ 5 vowels
python â†’ o â†’ 1 vowel
Keep only those words where vowel count > 2
Output should be: ["education"] (because only that has > 2 vowels)
