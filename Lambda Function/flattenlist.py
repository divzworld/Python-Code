"""
ðŸ§  INTERVIEW TAKEAWAY

If they ask why + works here, answer:

"Because list concatenation with + merges two lists into one, and reduce() keeps applying that until only one final list is left."
âœ… Step-by-step:

reduce() starts with first two elements:

x = [1, 2], y = [3, 4] â†’ x + y = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Then takes result [1, 2, 3, 4] as new x and next element y = [5] â†’ [1, 2, 3, 4] + [5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Final result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
