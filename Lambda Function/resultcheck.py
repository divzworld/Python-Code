ðŸ§  TEACHER'S INTERVIEW NOTE

This is interview-ready code â€” clean, no extra loops, no if-statements outside lambda.
If they ask "Why not use filter?" you can say:

"Filter() would remove the failing students entirely, but here I need both pass and fail as output, so map() is the right choice."
